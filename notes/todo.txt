- add css modules https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader 
- refactor redux modules / actions into different files that are then composed
- implement server-side rendering for inital app download
  -- maybe after that cookies will work
- start thinking about how I'm going to implement the different post sorting algorithms

DONE 0. create a Button component

0b. fix top nav bar 
  -> state defaults to home tab selected, should default to whatever the url is
  -> also, if you click the very bottom of a tab, you can select the tab without being taken to the page

DONE 1. refactor forms
  -> I use forms in Login, Register, CreatePost, etc. and I have to repeat a lot of styling / formatting so I should make a Form component that wraps everything
  -> Will be a good exercise in refactoring


2. integrate Sass & CSS modules 
  -> This will make my life easier down the line when I start doing media queries, etc.

3. implement voting feature

4. implement subspace feature
  -> user shall be able to "visit" a subspace
  -> user shall be able to post to a subspace
  -> a user shall be able to create a subspace
  -> a user shall be able to customize a subspace 

5. implement comments for posts feature 
  -> use mongo for comments?
  -> allow editing of post for creator?
  => think about comment sorting algorithms
  
6. implement show account feature 
  -> if logged in && user = loggedInUser then show settings, etc.
  -> if user != loggedInUser then show a feed of what they've posted, commented, etc.

7. implement tags feature
  -> user should be able to filter posts that have a tag (or multiple?)
