- add css modules https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader 
- refactor redux modules / actions into different files that are then composed
- implement server-side rendering for inital app download
  -- maybe after that cookies will work
- start thinking about how I'm going to implement the different post sorting algorithms

0. create a Button component

0b. fix top nav bar 
  -> state defaults to home tab selected, should default to whatever the url is

1. refactor forms
  -> I use forms in Login, Register, CreatePost, etc. and I have to repeat a lot of styling / formatting so I should make a Form component that wraps everything
  -> Will be a good exercise in refactoring

2. integrate Sass & CSS modules 
  -> This will make my life easier down the line when I start doing media queries, etc.
